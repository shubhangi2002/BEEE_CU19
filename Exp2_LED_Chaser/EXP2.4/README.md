# Experiment 2.4 - LED Chasher Odd Even
In this experiment, we created **LED Chaser Lights** with the help of an **Arduino** in which the LEDs turns on and off 
without any delay in such a way that first all the Even LEDs turns on and off and then all the Odd LEDs turns on.
This process continues in a loop.
